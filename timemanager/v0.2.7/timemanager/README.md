ðŸ“± **Looking for a mobile companion app?** Try the [Android app (currently in beta)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jbservices.nc_timemanager_app) made by [@joleaf](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app).

## Features

* Organize time entries based on tasks, projects and clients.
* Quickly record a time entry for your latest tasks.
* Check or uncheck a time entry (e.g. to save whether you've billed it).
* Get summaries of your time spent on tasks, projects and clients.
* Take a glance at simple, but useful statistics.
* Create basic reports using filters, timerange selection and a simple graph.

## Planned features

* _Allow tracking of time in the background._
* _Collaboration with other users â€“Â right now you can only view and edit your own time entries._
* _Performance improvements._
* _Work with start & end of time entry or duration._
* _Allow to organize time entries without assigning them to tasks, projects or clients._

## Development
The client-side JavaScript of this plugin uses ES6 features and needs to be transpiled for use in a browser. To run a watch command that automatically updates the `bundle.js` file when you make changes, execute `npm run dev`. To make a simple build, use `npm build`.

Before building or development, dependencies need to be installed once by running `npm install`.

## Changelog

### 0.2.7 Beta, 4. December 2021
- Maintenance: Bump compatibility to Nextcloud 23
- Maintenance: Update JS dependencies
- Bugfix: Filter selects â€“ Add missing color customisations for dark-mode (issue #59)
- Bugfix: Reports â€“ Improve completeness of reports at the beginning and end of an interval (issue #58)

### 0.2.6 Beta, 13. November 2021
#### IMPORTANT
**If you experience sync issues with the Android app by [@joleaf](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app), please install this update at your earliest convenience and restart the Android app to clear the sync queue. It will most likely resolve those issues. Details below.**

- Bugfix: Don't assume that clients can handle sync conflicts (issue #53). 

> This is sort of a regression, caused by #48 being fixed. Previously the bug described in #48 prevented the API to ask for client-side conflict handling, making the Android app work as it did. 

> Since there's no API documentation and the API changed because of this bugfix, the Android app is not to blame for this. This release makes sync behavior configurable, defaulting to the sync behavior previous to 0.2.5. I've opened an [issue in the app's repository](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app/-/issues/4) to work on adjusting to the different API signature and getting conflict handling implemented in the Android app. If you've left a negative review in the PlayStore based on this issue, please consider updating it, if this release fixes the issue for you. If not, please open an issue in this repository or the [Android app's repository](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app). 

> **Note:** If you've synced your [Android app (currently in beta)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jbservices.nc_timemanager_app) with release 0.2.5 you might experience duplicate objects. **This release contains a database migration that will fix these duplicate objects and prevent them in the future**, however you might need to sort out manually which ones you'd like to keep and which ones to delete. Very sorry for the inconvenience!

> _As an aside: I'm actively working on setting up a test pipeline for API integrations that will catch these sort of errors in the future. After all, this is a good reminder that this app, as well as the Android app, are still in beta state._

### 0.2.4 Beta, 15. July 2021
