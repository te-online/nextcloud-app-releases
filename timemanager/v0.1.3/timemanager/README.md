## Development
The client-side JavaScript of this plugin uses ES6 features and needs to be transpiled for use in a browser. To run a watch command that automatically updates the `bundle.js` file when you make changes, execute `npm run dev`. To make a simple build, use `npm build`.

Before building or development dependencies need to be installed once by running `npm install`.
