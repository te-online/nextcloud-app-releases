📱 **Looking for a mobile companion app?** Try the [Android app (currently in beta)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jbservices.nc_timemanager_app) made by [@joleaf](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app).

## Features

- 💅 Organize time entries based on tasks, projects and clients.
- 🎤 Quickly record a time entry for your latest tasks.
- ✅ Check or uncheck a time entry (e.g. to save whether you've billed it).
- 🧑‍💻 Get summaries of your time spent on tasks, projects and clients.
- 📊 Take a glance at simple, but useful statistics.
- 📒 Create basic reports using filters, timerange selection and a simple graph.
- 🤝 Track your time together with others by sharing a client and its associated projects and tasks (_web app only_).

## Planned features

- _Allow tracking of time in the background._
- _Work with start & end of time entry or duration._
- _Allow to organize time entries without assigning them to tasks, projects or clients._
- _REST API improvements for mobile clients_

## Development

The client-side JavaScript of this plugin uses ES6 features and needs to be transpiled for use in a browser. To run a watch command that automatically updates the `bundle.js` file when you make changes, execute `npm run dev`. To make a simple build, use `npm build`.

Before building or development, dependencies need to be installed once by running `npm install`.

## Automated testing

Some end-to-end testing is done using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Tests currently cover basic features of the app and run in a headless Chrome browser on a dockerized Nextcloud instance. For this repository tests run on [a mirror repository on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/te-online/timemanager).

To run tests locally, change into the `tests` directory. Before running or working on tests, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Make sure to create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and a `cypress.env.json` based on `cypress.env.example.json`; values can be chosen freely, only make sure they align between the two files.

To run the app install docker and docker-compose on your machine. Then run `docker-compose up`, followed by `docker exec $(docker ps -qf "name=app") sh -c 'chown www-data:root custom_apps'`. Wait for the app to be ready, then run `docker exec -u www-data $(docker ps -qf "name=app") sh -c 'php -f ./occ app:disable firstrunwizard'`.

Finally, run `npm start` and use Cypress' UI to start running the tests included in the spec file.

To shut down containers and delete the temporary volumes, run `docker-compose down -v` in a second terminal while you're in the same `tests` directory.

Test cases might depend on running in a specific order. This means you might need to wind down your docker containers and start them again as described above when re-running tests.

**New features** are supposed to be covered by end-to-end tests in a way that reflects their average usage.

**Bugfixes** are supposed to include a test case that demonstrates the bug being fixed and prevent it to be re-introduced in the future.

### 0.2.6 Beta, 13. November 2021

#### IMPORTANT

**If you experience sync issues with the Android app by [@joleaf](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app), please install this update at your earliest convenience and restart the Android app to clear the sync queue. It will most likely resolve those issues. Details below.**

- Bugfix: Don't assume that clients can handle sync conflicts (issue #53).

> This is sort of a regression, caused by #48 being fixed. Previously the bug described in #48 prevented the API to ask for client-side conflict handling, making the Android app work as it did.

> Since there's no API documentation and the API changed because of this bugfix, the Android app is not to blame for this. This release makes sync behavior configurable, defaulting to the sync behavior previous to 0.2.5. I've opened an [issue in the app's repository](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app/-/issues/4) to work on adjusting to the different API signature and getting conflict handling implemented in the Android app. If you've left a negative review in the PlayStore based on this issue, please consider updating it, if this release fixes the issue for you. If not, please open an issue in this repository or the [Android app's repository](https://gitlab.com/joleaf/nc-timemanager-mobile-app).

> **Note:** If you've synced your [Android app (currently in beta)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jbservices.nc_timemanager_app) with release 0.2.5 you might experience duplicate objects. **This release contains a database migration that will fix these duplicate objects and prevent them in the future**, however you might need to sort out manually which ones you'd like to keep and which ones to delete. Very sorry for the inconvenience!

> _As an aside: I'm actively working on setting up a test pipeline for API integrations that will catch these sort of errors in the future. After all, this is a good reminder that this app, as well as the Android app, are still in beta state._

- Bugfix: Make sure to round outputs of totals in Statistics module (issue #52)

### 0.2.5 Beta, 29. September 2021

### 0.2.4 Beta, 15. July 2021

- Bugfixes
  - Reports: More detailed filters are now prioritized over parent filters. _Example: Filtering for a specific project overrides any client filters set._ This might not be ideal, but at least it delivers more predictable results for most use-cases (issue #33)
  - Reports: The graph is now respecting configured filters (issue #37)
  - Dashboard: The statistics module is looking for time entries on the last day of a week again (issue #35)
